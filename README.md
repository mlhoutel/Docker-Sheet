## In short...
That’s my **help sheets**, where I put all the **usefull commands**, **tips** and **tricks** that I find on the subjects that I study, covering:
- Programming
- IT
- Mathematics
- Physics
- etc

This website is primarly built for me to check the things I may have forgot, but also to make my learning on these subject easier:

I realy like to write down and retranscrible with my words processes that can seem complex, but that can be explained with simplicity. It’s not an easy task, but I tried my best to make these explanations understandable.
