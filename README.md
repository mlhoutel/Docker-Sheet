That’s my help sheets, where I put all the usefull commands, tips and tricks that I find on the subjects that I study, and even more…

This website is primarly built for me to check the things I may have forgot, but also to make my learning on these subject easier:

I realy like to write down and retranscrible with my words processes that can seem complex, but that can be explained with simplicity. It’s not an easy task, but I tried my best to make these explanations understandable.

Good luck!
